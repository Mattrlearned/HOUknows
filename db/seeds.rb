Sites were approved by the T.D.A. based on their eligibility requirements, which designate eligible areas as those served by a school in which 50% or more of the children enrolled are eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals. There are no enrollment requirements for the C.A.C.F.P. program. Participating youth will be served a free snack and supper between 3:00 and 6:00 pm, Monday through Friday, from September 2, 2014, through May 28, 2015. H.P.A.R.D. manages the program for the City of Houston and participating sites are sponsored under H.P.A.R.D.
